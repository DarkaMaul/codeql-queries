# Overview

This directory contains CodeQL queries targeted at C and C++ cryptographic implementations.

The CodeQL queries are based on the abstract base types defined in `trailofbits/cpp-all` library.
The intention is that they should be easy to extend to other cryptographic libraries written in either C or C++.
